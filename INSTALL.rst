The library is built with `fpm <https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/index.html>`_ which will
build the fortran code into a static library and install it.
An additional Makefile is provided to be ran after fpm which will add several additional options

* link the objects generated by fpm into a shared library if needed
* install the C headers if the C API is needed
* uninstall all libraries and headers

On windows, `msys2 <https://www.msys2.org>`_ needs to be installed.
