NAME
    ecx - library for electrochemistry

SYNOPSIS
    ecx (Fortran): use ecx
    ecx (C): include "ecx.h"
    ecx (python): import pyecx

DESCRIPTION
    ecx a Fortran library for providing a collection of routines for electrochemistry.
    A C API allows usage from C, or can be used as a basis for other wrappers.
    A Python wrapper allows easy usage from Python.

    It covers:

      o kinetics  Nernst, Butler-Volmer
      o electrochemical  Impedance, Admittance, Circuit Elements, Equivalent Circuits
      o photoelectrochemistry  Photocurrent, Band-gap, space charge.

    The C API is defined by adding a prefix to the functions from the Fortran
    API due to the lack of module/namespace feature in the C language.
    The functions are therefore following this template:
    (c_prefix)fortran_func.

        o (ecx_)get_version
        o (ecx_core_)kTe
        o (ecx_eis_)z
        o mm
        o (ecx_kinetics_)nernst
        o (ecx_kinetics_)sbv
        o (ecx_kinetics_)bv
        o (ecx_eis_)z

NOTES
    To use ecx within your fpm <https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm>
    project, add the following lines to your file:

        [dependencies]
        ecx = { git="https://github.com/MilanSkocic/ecx.git" }

EXAMPLE
    Minimal example in Fortran:

        use ecx
