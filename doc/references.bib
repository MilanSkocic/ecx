  abstract     = {Chromium nitride films were prepared by anodically oxidizing nitride ions at 0.4-1.5 V versus Li+/Li on chromium substrates in molten LiCl-KCl-Li3N systems at 723 K. A crystalline Cr2N film was successfully prepared at 0.4-1.4 V, and was thicker at more positive electrolytic potential. At 1.5 V, a Cr-N film could be also obtained, but its growth rate was relatively low. The film prepared at 1.5 V consisted of two distinctive layers. The surface layer was amorphous Cr-N containing crystalline CrN particles, and the inner layer was crystalline CrN. It was considered the existence of the amorphous phase suppressed the film growth. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {CrN multilayer coatings are possible replacements for hard chromium because of their good mechanical and chemical properties. This paper focuses on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the mechanism of electrochemical stripping of multilayered Cr-N based coatings. The samples were produced by electron beam (e-beam) physical vapour deposition (PVD), on mirror polished M2 steel. Multilayers constituted three separate layers of CrN with intermediate interlayers of Cr (0.1 𝜇m). The total coating thickness was in the range 4.5-5.5 𝜇m. Under galvanostatic conditions, anodic oxidation of CrN leads to replacement of nitrogen in the CrN coating by oxygen, forming oxy-nitrides on the samples surface. Contrary to findings described by some authors, we have not detected Cr6+ in this research. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The electrochemical behavior and the chemical composition of passive films formed on the Alloy 690\textbackslash,at room temperature in borate buffer solution (pH\textbackslash,=\textbackslash,9.0) was studied with different techniques for two surface finishings. XPS and quantum yield measurements showed the presence of Ni and Cr oxides and hydroxides for passive films formed on both the as received and the mechanically polished one, whereas the presence of mixed spinel type Ni(1-x)FexCr2O4 was only observed on the as received material. Additionally, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) highlighted a higher corrosion resistance for the as received alloy in comparison with the mechanically polished alloy, which was linked to the chemical composition of the oxide film. Electrochemical measurements were performed before, during, and after oxidation of the Alloy 690 of Steam Generator (SG) tube of Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) at high temperature and high pressure in the simulated primary circuit of PWR. At high temperature, the interface becomes electrochemically active yielding the precipitation of the corrosion products which form a few tens of nm thick diffusion barrier for the released metal cations. This overlayer is built on the top of a few nm thick, Cr-rich inner-layer at the alloy/oxide interface which was found to behave similarly to that initially formed at ambient temperature. It is concluded that high temperature oxidation in the static condition of an autoclave at 325\textbackslash,\textasciicircum\textbackslash circC does not promote a better passivation state than the one already existing initially.},

Even if the overall oxide film formed on the alloy can reach several micrometers in thickness, only a compact oxide sub-layer of a few nanometers contributes to the impedance response.},
