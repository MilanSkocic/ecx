\section{C}
The C API strictly defines the same the functions, subroutines and constants
defined in the Fortran API (see \$\ref{sec_api_fortran}). 
A prefix \code{\NAME \_} is added due to the lack of 
namespaces in the C language.

The arguments have the same names as those defined in the Fortran API and
have the same meaning. 
Additional arguments of type \code{size\_t} are necessary when passing arrays
as pointer. The additional arguments providing the size of pointers is 
named as following \code{n<POINTER\_ARGUMENT\_NAME>}.
