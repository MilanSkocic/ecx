Application to different systems are used to illustrate the importance of using the correct formula that corresponds to a given type of distribution. Experiments and simulations are used to show that the effective capacitance obtained for a normal distribution yields correct values for the film thickness under conditions where the local resistivity does not vary significantly. When the local resistivity varies considerably over the thickness of a film, the experimental frequency range may preclude observation of the capacitance contribution of a portion of the film, resulting in under prediction of the film thickness.},

The correlations derived are tested versus recent experimental results regarding mixed oxides, anhydrous passive films on metallic alloys and hydroxide layers. The effect of the eventual long-range disorder into the passive film on the optical band gap values is also discussed. New experimental evidence reported for mixed d,d-metal oxides and passive films on sp,d-metal alloys gives satisfactory agreement with the theoretical expectations. The experimental results evidence the role of the alloying metal in determining the crystalline or disordered structure of passive films grown on Al,d-metal alloys.},

  abstract = {A critical assessment of the Photocurrent Spectroscopy (PCS) Technique for the semi-quantitative characterization of passive film and corrosion layers composition is carried out. We take into account more than three decades of PCS usage as ``in-situ'' analytical technique and related results as well as the criticism of the underlying semi-empirical correlation relating the measured optical bandgap (Eg) to the passive film composition. The discrepancies between the experimental data, gathered by PCS measurements, and Eg estimates originating from recently developed Density Functional Theory based modeling of solid state properties are stressed with particular emphasis on the case of anodic passive film grown on technologically important alloys (Fe-Cr and stainless steels). The extension of this correlation to mixed oxides and its use for relating the oxide composition to the bandgap values is critically reviewed by comparing the predicted Eg of mixed oxides with the experimental values. Suggestions on how to account for different bandgap values of oxide polymorphs and how to correlate the Eg values to the composition of mixed s,p-d-metal oxides are presented and discussed on the basis of experimental results reported in the literature. On the basis of this assessment, the ability of PCS in providing quantitative information on the composition of passive film and corrosion layer is generally confirmed.},
